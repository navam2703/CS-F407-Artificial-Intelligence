Let us see how you can land a job in Management.
Most employers require a college degree in either liberal arts, social sciences, or business administration. 
A master's degree in business administration (MBA) is also a common requirement.
So getting into a good management school for post graduation should be the goal.
College courses aren't especially useful but POM and SCM are relevant.
Getting into E-cell, DoSM, DePP, or leadership positions in any club of your choice is a bonus.
A CGPA above 7 is decent for immediate jobs, but IIM's require a high CGPA.
